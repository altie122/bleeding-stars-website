Hello it's your local horror and fantasy fanatic - Severus , or Silas as some may know! I am the voice actor of the beloved Alyx and I have helped, or tried to help, with many different parts of production. My major two of course resolve with art and voice acting! I like to read, write and draw and have been learning to animate! I also work on other projects and write my own books, shout out to all the Alyx fans!
